        “A successful website does three things: It attracts the right kinds of
        visitors. Guides them to the main services or product you offer. Collect
        Contact details for future ongoing relation.”

        This is a sample blog created using HTML and CSS. I whole heartedly
        Thank Colt Steele for guiding throughout the course thereby building up
        my confidence in the basics of Front-end Web Development. I also thank
        Sirius Computer Solutions for this oppurtunity to hone my Full Stack Web
        Development skills.

        Hello everyone, Jonathan, a computer science student interested in Web
        Development and Machine Learning. I love learning new technologies and
        enhancing my skills everyday. According to me, a day is a waste if you
        don't spend it on improving yourself.
